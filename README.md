# Introduction
    The intention of this project is to introduce Magic: the Gathering Deck Semantics into a subset of Markdown syntax.
		This new Markdown subset language also conforms to the syntax acknowledged by deckstats.net, and may be analyzed on the website.
# Decks
## Multiplayer Mill Deck
    The current state of my multiplayer, mill deck is in the index of this project.
		It is meant as an example of how to use the language.
