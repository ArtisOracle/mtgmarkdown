# Introduction
    The intention of this project is to introduce Magic: the Gathering Deck Semantics into a subset of Markdown syntax.
		This new Markdown subset language also conforms to the syntax acknowledged by deckstats.net, and may be analyzed on the website.
		
		I have forked this from GitHub from [ttahmouch's GitHub](https://github.com/ttahmouch). This fork is intended to be my repisitory 
			for managing my own Magic: the Gathering decks.
# Decks
## Multiplayer Discard Deck
    The all-black discard deck I play is located in the index.
